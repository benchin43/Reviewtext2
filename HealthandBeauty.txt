All of the generic or cheaper brands did not last long.1) Older Generic - In my smoke alarms - they ran out of juice in just 6 months as I discovered when the smoke alarm beeped in the middle of the night.2) Radio - The generic and cheap brand lasted about one year, but no more.BELOW IS WHAT IS HAVE RECEIVED WHEN I USE THE DURACELL 9 VOLT:1) Smoke Alarms - So now I get at least two to three years!2) Radio - I still have the Duracell battery in my radio and it is still strong.

I use these in one huge flashlight and in two motion sensor lights on our house. I can't tell you that these are better than the bunny batteries, but from my experience, these just keep going, and going, and going. Since the motion sensors are used on a nightly basis (the sensors have picked up raccoons, skunks, and opossums which we didn't even know we had in suburbia), I think it's amazing that we haven't had to replace the batteries yet, and the light is still as strong as ever.", 'The Lantern I ordered takes 8 batteries so having this 10-count is great with 2 extra for flash light.

Also, it was extremely easy to open, needing only a small pair of scissors to cut where indicated.I also recently purchased an 8-count package of Duracell C-cells.

You can't beat the price; then, you have them for what you need plus a few extra.", 'There is a reviewer who specializes in reviewing batteries and does a very, very thorough, erudite and insightful job of it.  So it is with utmost temerity and respect that I tread these waters.  I am the last person on earth to demean batteries. I mean, where would we be without them?  No flashlights, no little handfans. No smoke detectors. Can you imagine a world where you had to get off the couch to change the TV channel? I remember those days and it was hell.  No, we need batteries. Without batteries, our favorite gizmos would be useless...but how do you tell them apart?The Duracells certainly look authoritative and batterylike. They dropped right into the battery-compartment of the battery-operated lantern without a fight, making a rather satisfying thudding sound as they hit bottom.  I am happy to report that they did not explode, burst info flame or display any other bad battery behavior.  I remember in the old days, batteries would sometimes Go Rogue on you. You\'d open up the flashlight and all sorts of bubbly gray gook would be erupting from them and it was pretty disgusting. I have never seen a Duracell do this, but to be fair, I have seen no other battery do it either, not for many, many years. Obviously we have come a long, long way in terms of Battery technology.The D, by the way was plainly marked, so there could be no mistake...although the size is a dead give away. In the box with your other batteries, they are like Orson Welles in a room full of Don Knotts. So were the little Plus and Minus signs, so you would know which end went in first.  Although they could have been a little bigger, now that I think of it.  A lot bigger.  But none of the other batteries offer this large print, so I won\'t take away any stars.Dura-Cell implies "Durable" so I expected a tough battery -- but really, how tough does it have to be? I\'m not kicking it across the road before it goes into the flashlight, am I?  So duration is really the only thing to measure, beyond the other factors previously mentioned.  Now I know some batteries claim to last longer, the energizer bunny and all that, but I always forget to time them and sometimes you use a flashlight or a gizmo more and sometimes you use it less, so it\'s hard to judge.  I\'m assuming if one really did outperform all the others, it would be common knowledge, but it\'s not, so I just have to go by what I can in terms of rating.  On the other hand, I did buy a four pack of batteries for a buck at the 99 Cent Store.  I think they were call Emmagizers, so naturally I was fooled.  They were not a good choice and I would warn anyone planning to stock up on batteries with names similar to name brands to think twice, particularly if they are intended for your Pacemaker.  So, five stars for a battery that fits into the battery compartment, sports a very manly and handsome combination of bronze and black colors, and so far has given me all that I dare hope for from a battery.One question: Wouldn\'t it just be easier to have one size battery because invariably, when you have a bunch of As in the junk drawer, the flashlight that burns out requires Cs, and when you buy C cells, the next Gizmo needs Ds.  And it doesn\'t matter anyway because when you get to the store, you never remember which size it was you needed and buy the wrong size.  And those little guys, the AAs? What\'s the story with them?  How many penlights are we carrying around already.  And don\'t get me started on those square guys. And while we\'re at it, how come there are no B cell batteries? One more thing...those big gigantic flashlights that need the big BIG square battery...the battery alone always costs more than when you buy the flashlight with the battery. SOmething fish going on there if you ask me.This whole battery thing is starting to look suspicious...like it\'s all being rigged by some international battery cartel. I could explore this possibility more but the cat is now fighting me for control of the keyboard and the only wise thing to do is to log off.

It is the compact size that I wanted for my purpose.', 'This is the traditional incandescent Mini Maglite that has been used and loved for several decades now. While it is not expensive ($11, 14 lumens), the old incandescent light bulb technology lacks in many aspects when compared to the new LED technology. If you still like the Maglite design, they offer three Mini Maglite LED technologies; the Mini Maglite LED ($16, 77 lumens), Mini Maglite LED Pro ($20, 226 lumens), and the Mini Maglite LED Pro Plus ($24, 245 lumens bright mode).I found a Mini Maglite once tossed on the side of a rural road at a sharp turn. One can only imagine how it got there. Regardless, the body had some deep scores and dents in it, as if it rolled quite far and maybe even got run over a time or two. I was definitely surprised when I turned the head (it still turned smoothly and easily) and the light turned on, dim and yellow, of course, but steady. I took it home and added it to one of my emergency kits. Unfortunately, I placed bad batteries in it, which swelled up and corroded, causing problems with the springs inside. It was not too much of a loss as it was obtained for free, but the Maglite itself was great while it lasted.I plan on getting the Pro Plus as my primary EDC flashlight as it is made in the USA, to replace my cheap Ultrafire AA flashlight which has been showing random switch issues. While still quite outdated (Maglite is just catching up with the Mag-tac line), the price for the Pro Plus is about one half to one third of the price one would pay for a full-feature tactical light from 4Sevens, Fenix, or Zebralight, which despite their steep prices are all made in China.However, if you have a sentimental attachment to the dim yellow beam of a USA-made Maglite, buy it. Otherwise, get one of the LED models.', "This flashlight looks and feels great but it runs down batteries immediately.  Now my rarely used Maglite can't be opened to replace the battery - I suspect the battery leaked and glued the compartment shut.  In any event, it's dead after a very short life.

The size of the barrel of the flashlight is great for my hands when I need both of them to use and can just use my fingers to grasp instead of the whole hand.  Brightness of bulb is excellent since you can adjust the rays to be full or small to see just the focus of something detail.

I am using low discharge rechargeable batteries and they can't handle the below freezing temp; they are showing almost empty after just a couple of weeks.Lithium batteries are rated to perform even in extreme conditions from -40 degree Fahrenheit up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit.  Also, you have to hold to realize how light are these batteries compared to other conventional batteries.", "I used these when I went on a month long safari. Had no chance of resupply and did not want to take too many standard batteries as I found in my experience that the high humidity, despite being in a tight container, drained most of the charge before I used them. Took two sets of these lithium AA plus other brands as backup. Didn't need them as the one set in my camera and one set in my recorder were still working good after I had returned. They endured over 100F to a 32F at night, 90% humidity, heavy rain, damn mosquitoes (ah..wait..that was my gripe) and worked very well. Did not have a problem with having to wait for them to recharge my units like other cheaper brands.", 'What can I say, look at the amp hour rating and that says it all. These are the only way to go.', "The flat discharge curve of lithiums means they will stay above the UVLO (Under-Voltage Lock Out) conditions of your electronics power supplies. Today's electronics do not just keep working until all the juice is gone. They monitor the input voltage and when it drops too low to guarantee a stable output, they shut off. Normal batteries may still have some juice left in them but nothing other than flashlights can really make use of it. Lithiums go most of the way from full health to death in a relatively flat curve so your electronics will get longer life. Maybe only 10% to 15% wasted energy left when done compared to 40%+The price is worth it.", 'Good long lasting AA batteries sold at a good price on Amazon...not always available in the stores at home or abroad; I carry a bag of these when traveling overseas to put in my little camera, head lamp, etc...they last and last....', "I put these batteries in a battery-driven can opener.  Nickel Cadmium batteries were not holding up more than a couple of weeks.  These Lithium Ion batteries have been in use for about three weeks now, and I have not noticed any loss of power.  I'd buy these batteries again.", 'Cheaper to buy batteries online. Lithium last longer. Keep in a cool place, but not in the refrigerator like alkaline batteries.', 'A very good brand and product. It holds a charge. Not like the lithium, but works just the same. Again with the minimum.', 'Lithium Cells are rapidly becoming the new gold standard for many household uses, from simple flashlights to sophisticated hybrid vehicles.  These lithium-ion batteries are now ubiquitous at the retail level and their popularity has steadily increased because of their power efficiency compared to more traditional delivery technologies far surpassing carbon-zinc, nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal hydride and alkaline.Here Is my Assessment of The Energizer AAA "Ultimate" Lithium:PROS:1. Superior in power efficiency compared to above-cited technologies.  Lithium cells hold their charge longer and become superior performers in retaining their charge.  When stored properly (in a cool, dry and dark environment), these cells self-discharge rates are substantially slower compared with previous generations of batteries.2. Unlike nickel-cadmium cells, lithium-ion batteries have no (or a very negligible) "memory" effect.3. Lithium Cells appear less likely to leak and are not as vulnerable to extreme temperatures compared with previous technologies.4. Lithium-Ion cells also perform better at lower ambient temperatures than their predecessors.5. Lithium-Ion batteries are noticeably lighter than previous types of cells making it an additional plus in heavier types of equipment such as larger flashlights, power equipment, etc.6. Energizer cells have expiration dates considerably longer because they discharge much more slowly compared to previous generations of batteries.7. Lithium cells are more environmentally-compliant and friendly compared to previous generations, particularly those cells which contain toxic, heavy metals such as cadmium and mercury.CONS:1. My rating on these cells is 4.5 stars due to the perceived steep price points of the Energizer brand that most folks believe.  However, if you do the math, as another astute reviewer has, you will find that lithium cells are actually a more cost-effective choice when compared to an equivalent-sized alkaline battery.  Nevertheless, you are still likely to pay more for a name brand such as Energizer, in order for the company to recoup their research and development costs.2. Lithium cells may be a safety hazard, particularly when exposed to high temperatures for sustained periods of time.  For this reason, the federal government has imposed transport restrictions on lithium batteries.  Although these restrictions have recently been relaxed, lithium cells can and do explode because they contain a pressurized, flammable electrolyte. For this reason, it is advisable to store these cells in a temperature-stable environment.3. Energizer currently has several different "versions" of their "Ultimate" Lithium batteries on the retail market.  Some packages state "up to 4x longer" while newer versions announce on the front of the blister card up to 8x or 9x longer in selected devices.  Be careful to select the latest available expiration date card(s) to avoid purchasing an earlier version of the product. Each cell also has a production/ lot code embossed on it; however, they are not at present, user-identifiable without assistance from Energizer.BOTTOM LINE:1. These are excellent batteries when used properly and in the correct equipment.  In consideration of the longer storage and discharge interval, my recommendation would be to use lithium cells for those appliances and equipment requiring longer replacement intervals such as fire, smoke and CO2 detectors; water sensors, outdoor sensors, digital cameras and remote controls to name just a few.2. Avoid storing these cells in extreme temperatures-cool, dark and dry is recommended for maximum shelf life and safety. Avoid storing lithium cells in the refrigerator or freezer.3. Energizer lithiums are, in my opinion, no better than those manufactured by other reputable companies.  As such, price shop.  If store (generic) lithiums are available, shop with your wallet.  This is an excellent technology but you need to use and store them wisely.', 'Installed on a detector where the ceiling is 15 Ft.

Worked like a charm, but it did soil the brush a bit.  I simply put a bit of bleach in some sudsy water and it immediately came clean.  Then I rinsed it well and dried it.  I was expecting a stiff brush, but instead got one that was soft, but just stiff enough to do those tricky jobs.  Really pleased with this purchase.', 'A good bottle brush is a necessity for cleaning those reusable glass bottles that I carry daily for water or juice, etc.  This is a good brush made by OXO.

Quick to the chase, this was my issue with drinking coffee and having to clean the Thermos canister every now and then was usually a time consuming nightmare.It is quite difficult to clean these canisters usually because water splashing and detergent isn't enough on its own. Using my hands to clean dirty materials is normally always the way I go about to clean something in need of clearing out but doing so for incredibly small and hollow canisters is &#34;impossible&#34; to do with hands alone.My hands are way too big to come close to fitting inside the small canister tops and I didn't know what I could use to scrub that coffee build up found inside the canisters.

So we are constantly washing water bottles that come home from games and practices.  This brush is perfect for cleaning these bottles.  (And I imagine it would work just as well for baby bottles.)  My only complaint is that the bristles compress or collapse over time, so I find I have to replace this brush about every 3 or 4 months.  I always buy the same one again, but I wish it lasted a bit longer!', "This was just what I needed.

My hands can't fit in any of my bottles. Most dishwashers aren't powerful enough to shoot water to the back of a thermos if it's in the dishwasher at and angle.

We lay it on the counter and let the brush part hang over into the sink.  It does a good job, though, even though the bristles are not as dense as other bottle brushes.  We had the other OXO brush with a stand, and while it was nice, the stand had a tendency to get moldy unless washed often.

I use it for my 32oz Nalgene bottles and it works fine, but I also use it for my 16oz Takeya Glass Bottles and it especially works AWESOME for those because it touches all the sides of the bottle when it's in it!  When it's in the Nalgene bottle you have to circle it around to get all the sides, but not so with the smaller diamater bottles.

This is a very well designed brush for grout and shower edges.", 'Brush is of good construction and handy for those hard to reach places.
